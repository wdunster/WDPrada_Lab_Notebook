Notes:
- Re running samples that have not yet worked from Box 4 and 2 samples that were contaminated during ITS2_Box1andBox4_BeadCleanUp_1

Procedure
Protocol adapted from [Emma Strand](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/ITS2-Sequencing-Protocol/)

Samples:
- OFAV = *Orbicella faveolata*
- OFRA = *Orbicella franksi*
- S = Shallow
- P = Deep

| Species | Treatment | ID    |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| OFAV    | S         | 0EV3  |
| OFAV    | S         | 2JQ31 |
| OFAV    | S         | 3AZ4  |
| OFAV    | S         | 4DW14 |
| OFAV    | S         | 0AZ4  |
| OFAV    | S         | 9EV5  |
| OFAV    | S         | BLANK |
| OFAV    | S         | BLANK |




1. Make a Master Mix (MM) of Water, 2X Mytaq solution, and Forward and Reverse ITS2 Primer

Master Mix:

| Component                   | Volume for 1 rxn  |  Volume for 8 rxns (+1% error)   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2x MyTaq Mix                | 25.0 uL           | 220 uL                           |
| Molecular Water             | 18.0 uL           | 158.4 uL                         |
| ITS2 Primer Forward (10 uM) | 2.0  uL           | 17.6 uL                          |
| ITS2 Primer Reverse (10 uM) | 2.0  uL           | 17.6 uL                          |
| DNA                         | 3.0 uL            | NA                               |

Samples were run in triplicate
2. Add 47 uL of MM to strip 1
3. Add 3 uL of DNA for each sample in strip 1 -- IN BLANK samples, 3 uL of Master Mix were added instead of DNA
4. Move 16.67 uL of solution from strip 1 to strip 2 and strip 3 so each tube contained about 16.6 uL


Strip Tube Set Up:

| Strip (replicate) Number | A     | B     | C      | D     | E     | F      | G     | H      |
|--------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1                        | 9EV5  | 0EV3  | 2JQ31  | 3AZ4  | 4DW14 | 0AZ4   | BLANK | BLANK  |
| 2                        | 9EV5  | 0EV3  | 2JQ31  | 3AZ4  | 4DW14 | 0AZ4   | BLANK | BLANK  |
| 3                        | 9EV5  | 0EV3  | 2JQ31  | 3AZ4  | 4DW14 | 0AZ4   | BLANK | BLANK  |


5. Thermocycle

Thermocycler Settings:

| Cycles | Time   | Temp |
|--------|--------|------|
| 1 	   | 3 min  | 95°  |
| 35     | 30 sec | 95°  |
|        | 30 sec | 52°  |
|        | 30 sec | 72°  |
| 1      | 5 min  | 72°  |
| 1      | ∞ min  | 4°   |

6. Run 5 uL of each product on a 2% agarose gel to check for ~250bp product
   Run gel for 60 mins at 100 volts

Failed:
0EV3, 2JQ31, 3AZ4, 4DW14


Next steps are to go ahead with PCR2 on samples that have run well. It is likely that DNA quality is too low in samples that are repeatedly not amplifying
