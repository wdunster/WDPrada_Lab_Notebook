- QC_WGS Submitted batch job 303626 - dDocent test run 
- 

## Feb 26
- QC_WGS extraction for 15 HO_ samples. The extraction went well with a mix of resutls from 30-300 ng/uL. See [extraction log](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/QC_WGS_Extraction_Log.md) for details. 
- Finished creating platemaps for MGPR21 protein assays. I will start working on these on Thursday and Friday this week. 

## Feb 6 
- Lab meeting - Juliane presents 
- Downloaded QC_WGS sequences from genohub and ran fastp
- URI employee cyber security training
- Prada Meeting
    - QC_WGS
        - Priority = QC on sequences 
        - New samples from Honduras should be extracted early next week 
        - We will probably have to blast our seq against proteins to make sure it is mollusc reads
    - Octo_rest
        - Review Carlos feedback 
        - Create abstract 
        - Send to TL by 2/14 for edits 
    
## Feb 5
- Meeting with Matias to chat about lcWGS analysis 
- Reading for DDocent and lcWGS analysis
