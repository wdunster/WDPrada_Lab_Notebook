## <a name="log"></a> **Daily Logs**
### Oct 19
- 8:00 am - 4:30 pm 
- QC_WGS extraiton 3
- The extraction went well with the new modification. I am going to leave them to incubate for 5 hrs instead of 3.5 tomorrow and hope for higher yields of DNA. I am still seeing an avg 10 ng/uL and ideally would like 15-20 ng/uL. The protocol gets smoother every time though!

### Oct 17
- QC_WGS Extraction 2

### OCT 16 
- QC_WGS Extraction 2 prep 

### Oct 15
- QC_WGS extraction 1

### Oct 14 
- QC_WGS Extraction 1 prep 

### Oct 12
- 8:00am - 4:00pm
- Diving with Taylor
- Inventory and labeling lab spaces


### Oct 10
- 7:45am - 3:45pm
- Octo_rest writing (2 hrs)
- Weekly meeting with Carlos 
    - Howie email takeaway = EF is more flexible and it depends on the location of breakage
    - G test to expand on chi square analysis of discrete data 
    - Nails
- Aliquoted new Omega Mollusc DNA extraction kit reagents. Carlos decided to use the new kit instead of the old one. I made aliquots for everything except the Chloroform:isoamyl which I will aliquot in the fume hood on Thursday. 

### Oct 09
- 7:30am - 1:30pm
- TL_RI23 cage extraction

### Oct 06
- 8:00am - 6:15pm (minus 1 hr off campus)
- Inventoried all drawers and added purchasing info to the Prada Lab inventory. Things are starting to come together though I still have some work to do on labeling all drawers and updating the map on sheets.

### Oct 05
- 7:45am - 3:45pm
- Labeled and filled cryo vials for TL_RI23 extraction next week. Store vials on shelf DS1
- Re diluted and pooled 10 samples for Raker_OFAV_16s amplification. Genohub (NextSeq) could not sequence these samples. I brought the 10 to Janet at URI sequencing to see if they can be sequenced on MySeq
- Jill showed me how to use VS code to connetc to GitHub as I had diverged the branches between my RStudio terminal and GitHub. Everything seems fixed now
- Reviewed and excepted GRFP edits from GWC
- Started organismal inventory
