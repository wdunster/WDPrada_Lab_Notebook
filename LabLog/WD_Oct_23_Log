### Oct 5
- 7:45am - 3:45pm
- Labeled and filled cryo vials for TL_RI23 extraction next week. Store vials on shelf DS1
- Re diluted and pooled 10 samples for Raker_OFAV_16s amplification. Genohub (NextSeq) could not sequence these samples. I brought the 10 to Janet at URI sequencing to see if they can be sequenced on MySeq
- Jill showed me how to use VS code to connetc to GitHub as I had diverged the branches between my RStudio terminal and GitHub. Everything seems fixed now
- Reviewed and excepted GRFP edits from GWC
- Started organismal inventory
