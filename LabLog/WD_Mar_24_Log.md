## Mar 12 
- RIDEM_WF_WGS test extraction following [Zymo Quick-DNA Mini-prep Plus kit]()
    - Notes: 
        - I double the digestion reaction volume because it did not seem like enough liquid for the size of the fin clippings. 
        - I then added an additional 95uL of Solid Tissue Buffer to 205-00006 because this fin clipping was much larger than the other sample 
        - After 2 hrs 
        - 1 vol = 370 uL for 158_00003 and Blank 
          1 vol = 470 uL for 205_00006 

| Sample ID | Preserve | Qbit Stock | Qbit Clean | 
|-----------|----------|------------|------------|
| 158_00003 | Dried    |   146      |     105    |
| 205_00006 | Dried    |   109      |    83.2    |
| Blank     | Blank    |    0       |         0  |

## Mar 11
- QC_WGS [extraction 22]((https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/QC_WGS_Extraction_Log.md))
- Started to look at JG edits to octo_rest MS
- Carlos and I met twice to discuss which kit and protocol to use for the winter-flounder DNA extractions. We are going to use Zymo Quick-DNA mini-prep plus kit (D4069) and follow the [blue workflow](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) for solid tissue

## Mar 8 
- 5 plates for MGPR21 protein assays 
- Shadowed TL for CHL assay 
- Disposed of lab hazardous waste   

## Mar 7
- Read Zymo mini prep kit and nucleo spin soil kit directions

## Mar 5 
- Prada weekly meeting
    - QC_WGS 
        - work through mtDNA using dDocent 
        - Carlos can teach me how to do each part manually if I have everything prepped for next week 
    - RIDEM_WFlounder
        - 5 fin clips in the chest freezer. We need to know if DNA can be extracted successfully for libraries by the end of the month
        - Use whole fin 
        - Try homogenizing with ceramic bead tubes 
        - Use Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep kit 
    - Mentoring 
        - Be very specific 
        - Make sure you are the one giving info so there is a direct pnt of contact 
- Octo_rest edits, writing, fixing figures. I sent a new draft of JG for edits. I need to fix test size on a few graphs

## Mar 4
- QC_WGS [extraction 21](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/QC_WGS_Extraction_Log.md) 
- Octo_rest writing

## Mar 1 
- MGPR21 4 protein assays 
- Organized samples and platemaps for easier future work 
- QC_WGS met with Matias to chat about how to use mtDNA as a reference genome and blast against the NCBI database.
    - upload mtDNA FASTA file from NCBI to the cluster 
    - when I already have a ref genome assembly = no in the dDocent .sh file 
    - less_ command allows you to view compressed files such as fastq.gz
