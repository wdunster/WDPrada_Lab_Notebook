## <a name="goals"></a> **February Goals**

Feb goals I finished: 
- QC_WGS
    - [] Finish Belize extractions (Wait to lib prep until more samples)
    - [x] Make Rmd file for lcWGS data analysis 
    - [x] Analyze genohub data 
- Octo_Rest
    - [] Submit another draft to Carlos 
    - [] Submit draft to review for a journal?
- TLAP
    - [x] Help with modeling 
    - [] Continue reading to fill in gaps in the paper 
- Lab 
    - [] Inventory post PCR freezers
    - [] Create an exit google form for the lab to know where peoples samples are and when they can be disposed of

March goals: 
- QC_WGS
    - [] Finish BZ and HO extractions
    - [] Run dDocent with mtDNA as ref genome
    - [] Run dDocent with indv from all sub populations
- Octo_Rest
    - [] Submit draft to Jack
    - [] Submit draft to review for a journal?
- TLAP
    - [] Help with modeling 
    - [] Continue reading to fill in gaps in the paper 
- MGPR21
    - [] Finish protein assays for all heat stress samples 
    - [] Finish chlorophyll assays for all heat stress samples
    - [] Send Matias analyzed data 
- Lab 
    - [] Inventory post PCR freezers
    - [] Create an exit google form for the lab to know where peoples samples are and when they can be disposed of

## Mar 4
- QC_WGS [extraction 21](https://github.com/wdunster/QC_WGS_23/blob/main/QC_WGS_Extraction_Log.md) 
- Octo_rest writing

## Mar 1 
- MGPR21 4 protein assays 
- Organized samples and platemaps for easier future work 
- QC_WGS met with Matias to chat about how to use mtDNA as a reference genome and blast against the NCBI database.
    - upload mtDNA FASTA file from NCBI to the cluster 
    - when I already have a ref genome assembly = no in the dDocent .sh file 
    - less_ command allows you to view compressed files such as fastq.gz
